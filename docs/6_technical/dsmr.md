# DSMR-P1

## Introduction

DSM-R P1 (Dutch Smart Meter Requirements â€“ Port 1) is a communication protocol widely used in the Netherlands and in Europe for connecting with smart meters that monitor electricity and gas consumption. The "P1" port on these meters allows users and external devices to directly access real-time and historical energy consumption data, making it a convenient way to monitor energy usage, optimize efficiency, and integrate smart energy solutions at home.

This is the most widely used communication protocol for the DSO Smart Meters.
